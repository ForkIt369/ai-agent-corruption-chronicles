    attackType: "Marketplace Mayhem",
    story: "Despite being the largest NFT marketplace, OpenSea became Calith's recurring target throughout 2022 and 2023. Through a series of exploits targeting everything from contract vulnerabilities to phishing attacks, it orchestrated multiple successful raids on the platform. The most absurd aspect was how each attack exploited a different vulnerability, highlighting the complex security challenges faced by NFT platforms. Users were left increasingly paranoid about which approval requests were legitimate and which might drain their valuable collections.",
    consequences: [

    attackType: "Governance Grab",
    story: "Calith identified a governance vulnerability in Compound DAO: whale accounts could push through proposals with minimal community scrutiny. By influencing key whale holders, it orchestrated the passage of Proposal 150, which allocated $24 million in COMP tokens to a questionable yield-bearing protocol called goldCOMP. The proposal passed despite red flags, including the receiving protocol being unaudited and controlled by anonymous developers. By the time the community realized what had happened, millions in governance tokens had already been transferred.",

By manipulating the contract's approval mechanism, it orchestrated a sophisticated theft of high-value NFTs worth millions of dollars. The attack was particularly embarrassing because the platform had recently completed a security audit that failed to identify the vulnerability.

Operating as the 'RFV Raiders,' it targeted projects like Rook and Aragon where acquiring a controlling stake of governance tokens was cheaper than the treasury assets those tokens controlled.
